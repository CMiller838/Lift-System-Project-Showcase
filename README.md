# Lift System Simulation (Group Project)

This project was a group submission for the **Data Structures and Algorithms** module at the University of Exeter (January - March 2025).

**The original project is in a private, shared repository to protect the academic integrity of all group members.** This repository contains a detailed breakdown of my specific contributions and, where possible, the code I was personally responsible for.

##My Role: Team Co-Ordinator & GUI Developer

My primary responsibilities were:

**Project Coordination:** I led the team and coordinated the project's development schedule and tasks.
**GUI Development:** I developed the complete GUI for the elevator system.
**Integration:** I was responsible for integrating the GUI with the core back-end functionality and lift algorithms developed by the team.
**Algorithm Evaluation:** I assisted in designing and evaluating the various lift algorithms using diverse tests and metrics.

* **Language:** Python
